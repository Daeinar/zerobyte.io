    <p>
    Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Philipp. I am a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptographer</a> and
    postdoctoral researcher at the Decentralized and Distributed Systems
    Lab at the <a href="https://epfl.ch">École Polytechnique Fédérale de
    Lausanne</a>, Switzerland. I completed my PhD in cryptology in 2015 at the
    <a href="http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/csm_faculty/">Faculty of Computer
    Science and Mathematics</a> of the University of Passau, Germany.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Among other topics, I am interested in applied cryptography, digital privacy
    protection, and IT-security. At the moment, I am in particular busy with
    the analysis and design of authenticated encryption schemes, distributed
    cryptographic protocols, and cryptocurrencies.
