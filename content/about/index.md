I am a cryptographer and hacker currently working as a
postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Decentralized and Distributed Systems Lab](http://dedis.epfl.ch/)
at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://epfl.ch), 
Switzerland. 

My research interests broadly include applied cryptography, information
security, and distributed and decentralized systems. I have published abundant
research at academic conferences like USENIX Security, EUROCRYPT, IEEE S&P
and many more. I am also regularly active at non-academic conferences such as
the Chaos Communication Congress or Troopers. Some projects that I have been
involved with include NORX, MEM-AEAD, cothority, RandHound, ByzCoin.

I completed my PhD in cryptology in 2015 at the [Faculty of Computer
Science and Mathematics](http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/csm_faculty/)
of the University of Passau, Germany. My PhD thesis, received the 
[2016 dissertation award](http://www.uni-passau.de/forschung/wissenschaftspreise/dissertationspreise/) 
of the University of Passau in the area of mathematics / computer science.

Currently, I work on next-generation authenticated
encryption schemes, decentralized protocols for unbiasable, public-verifiable
randomness, and scalability aspects of blockchain technology.
