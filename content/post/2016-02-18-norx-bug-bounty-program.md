Are you a cryptanalysis-ninja with differentials, boomerangs, and bicliques
being your weapons of choice? Do you know what IND-CPA, IND-CCA{1,2}, and
INT-{P,C}TXT actually mean and that querying random oracles has nothing to do
with randomly visiting astrologers? Or do your hacker-friends celebrate you as
the personified american fuzzy lop?

Well, if you answered **yes** to any of these questions and are up for a
challenge, then head over to [https://norx.io](https://norx.io) and find some
bugs in one (or all) of the following categories:

- **Bugs in the NORX algorithm** (a.k.a. cryptanalysis)
- **Bugs in the NORX security proofs** (evidence of a wrong proof and/or a wrong result)
- **Bugs in the NORX source code** (software bugs or inconsistencies with the specs)

If you answered **no** but are nevertheless up for a challenge, then head over to the NORX
website too and give it a try, as in each category you can win a bounty of
**&#36;250**! In order to get a reward, your submission has to be the winning
entry in one of the above categories.

The **deadline** for submissions is <s>May 31</s> **July 31, 2016** at **23:59 (UTC+01:00)**.
Send your findings to [contact@norx.io](contact@norx.io) and we will tell you if
your result is eligible. The winners of the bug bounty program will be announced
in the first week of <s>June</s> August, 2016.

Happy hunting!
