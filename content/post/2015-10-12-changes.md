After 10 years at the [University of Passau](http://www.uni-passau.de/en/), it
is time for me to leave its halls and close this chapter of my life.  This
saddens me quite a bit since I have many great memories connected to this
institution where I completed my studies and soon (hopefully) my PhD.  Moreover,
the small Bavarian city of [Passau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passau) with
its three rivers resting right at the border to Austria is a [wonderful
place](https://vimeo.com/103900893) to call home. The region around Passau is
also where I grew up and where all of my family and most of my friends live.
However, with one chapter closing another opens up and I am more than excited
about the path lying ahead.

On November 1st, 2015, I will be starting my
new position as a post-doctoral researcher at the *École Polytechnique Fédérale
de Lausanne* ([EPFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne)) in Switzerland.
There I will join the newly established *Decentralized and Distributed Systems
Lab* ([DEDIS](http://search.epfl.ch/ubrowse.action?acro=DEDIS)) lead by
[Prof. Bryan Ford](http://www.brynosaurus.com/)
who also switched only recently to EPFL coming from the
[DeDiS](http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/) group at Yale. I am really thankful for the
chance to further follow a path as a researcher and enthusiastic about the
opportunity to work at such a highly regarded scientific facility. Working in
the DEDIS team means that I will be shifting my focus a little bit away from
symmetric cryptography towards other research areas, such as privacy, which are
rather new to me but definitely not less interesting. Some of the projects Bryan
and his team are working on include:

- [Dissent](http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/), a novel tool for providing online anonymity,
  which does not rely on *onion routing* like
  [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) to achieve its goal but instead uses
  techniques based on the *dining cryptographers problem* and
  *verifiable shuffles*. Interestingly, the methods below Dissent and Tor seem to exclude
  each other by no means. Quite the contrary, it seems that they can be combined to obtain even greater
  benefits. Check out [this recent article](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dissent-a-new-type-of-security-tool-could-markedly-improve-online-anonymity) for an overview.
- [Cothorities](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08768), derived from *collective authorities*,
  which are a recent proposal to remove
  single point of failures from authority systems through decentralisation
  with the aim to increase general robustness and decrease vulnerability against malicious entities.
  One potential application are [certificate cothorities](https://petsymposium.org/2015/papers/syta-cc-hotpets2015.pdf),
  a proposal to strengthen the Internet's certificate authority
  system whose fragility could be witnessed time and again over the past years.
- [The DeDiS crypto library](https://github.com/DeDiS/crypto), which
  provides advanced cryptographic constructions such as *threshold signature
  schemes*, is an essential piece of technology to realise the above tools.

There are plenty of possibilities to investigate interesting research problems
in the fields of security, privacy and cryptography at this group and, at the
same time, also develop practical solutions. Moreover, with the
[LASEC](http://lasec.epfl.ch/) and [LACAL](http://lacal.epfl.ch/) groups being just
around the corner, there seem to be more than enough opportunities for further collaborations.

The changes in research fields are not the only ones however: since Lausanne
lies in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, I will also get the chance to
learn a new language. Beyond the simple *bonjour* and *au revoir*, I don't speak
a single word of French so far, a shortcoming that will change hopefully rather
quickly.

In any case, the times ahead will be full of new challenges and I am looking forward to
all of them with a thrill of anticipation.

À bientôt en Suisse[^1]!
