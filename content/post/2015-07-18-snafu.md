In the beginning was the plan, <br>
and then the specification; <br>
And the plan was without form, <br>
and the specification was void. <br>

And darkness <br>
was on the faces of the implementors thereof; <br>
And they spake unto their leader, saying: <br>
*"It is a crock of shit, and smells as of a sewer."* <br>

And the leader took pity on them, <br>
and spoke to the project leader: <br>
*"It is a crock of excrement, <br>
and none may abide the odor thereof."* <br>

And the project leader spake unto his section head, saying: <br>
*"It is a container of excrement, <br>
and it is very strong, <br>
such that none may abide it."* <br>

The section head then hurried to his department manager, <br>
and informed him thus: <br>
*"It is a vessel of fertilizer, <br>
and none may abide its strength."* <br>

The department manager carried these words to his general manager, <br>
and spoke unto him saying: <br>
*"It containeth that which aideth the growth of plants, <br>
and it is very strong."* <br>

And so it was that the general manager rejoiced <br>
and delivered the good news unto the Vice President. <br>
*"It promoteth growth, <br>
and it is very powerful."* <br>

The Vice President rushed to the President's side, <br>
and joyously exclaimed: <br>
*"This powerful new software product <br>
will promote the growth of the company!"* <br>

And the President looked upon the product, <br>
and saw that it was very good. <br>

**SNAFU principle: /sna'foo prin'si-pl/, n.** [from a WWII Army acronym for 'Situation Normal, All Fucked Up']

> True communication is possible only between equals, because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth.

A central tenet of [Discordianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism), often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically. The effect of the SNAFU principle is a progressive disconnection of decision-makers from reality.
